To get my certifications files, you need to create a `_data` folder in the root of your repository and add a `certifications.yml` file inside it. The `certifications.yml` file should contain your certifications data in the following format:

```yaml
- title: "Certification Title 1"
    organization: "Organization Name 1"
    link: "/certifications/Certification1.pdf"
    image: "https://example.com/image1.jpg"

- title: "Certification Title 2"
    organization: "Organization Name 2"
    link: "/certifications/Certification2.pdf"
    image: "https://example.com/image2.jpg"

# Add more certifications as needed
```

Make sure to place your PDF files in the `certifications` folder in your repository.
